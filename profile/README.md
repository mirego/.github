At [**Mirego**](https://www.mirego.com), we build a huge majority of our products using open source technologies (eg. [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir), [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift), [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin), etc.) maintained by stable, mature and active communities.

Itâ€™s very important for us to give back to these communities by either contributing directly to their projects or by providing libraries and tools that add value to their respective ecosystem.

You can find all of our open source projects here (with more information [here](https://open.mirego.com))! ðŸŽ‰
